This is a test suite for liblouisutdml. Every test is a subdirectory
and is completely self-contained, meaning all configuration files and
tables are in that directory. That's important if you want to have
good understanding of what the test does. You want to test isolated
features and limit the influences of unknown variables. Each
subdirectory contains at least the following files:

- input.xml
- expected.txt

- liblouisutdml.ini: The configuration. Should define a semantic
  actions file. The liblouis tables specified in this file should
  ideally point to files in the same directory to ensure the test is
  completely self-contained.
- styles.cfg: The style definitions.
- README: Info about the test that will be printed when in verbose mode.

For testing UTDML you'll need a more sophisticated way of comparing
the results. Right now as simple diff is made.
