The Java part of the bindings is not built by deffault. If you have ant 
installed you can simply type "ant" in this directory to get a jar file. 
If not, you can use the basic Java procedures.

The C part of the bindings is compiled into the library. If you get an 
error saying that jni.h cannot be found, install the Java extension for 
your C compiler.
